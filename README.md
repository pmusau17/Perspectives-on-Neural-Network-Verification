# Perspectives on Neural Network Verification

**Abstract**: 
Artificial Neural Networks have demonstrated an effective and powerful ability to solve problems in numerous contexts such as adaptive control, autonomous vehicles, evolutionary robotics, non-linear system identification, and image and pattern recognition. Despite achieving results that are comparable to human levels of accuracy and performance, there have been reservations about incorporating them into safety-critical systems due to an inability to formally reason about the  underlying models that govern their behavior. In light of this challenge, there has been a significant amount of work towards the creation of verification methods that are capable of identifying erroneous behaviors and providing formal guarantees about the safe operation of neural network applications. The following paper presents a survey of these works from three perspectives in an effort to trace the intellectual progression of this field and stimulate the creation of advanced verification methods that are capable of addressing the major challenges currently being faced within this context.

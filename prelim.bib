  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

abstract="Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are employed in many areas of industry such as pattern recognition, robotics, controls, medicine, and defence. Their learning and generalization capabilities make them highly desirable solutions for complex problems. However, they are commonly perceived as black boxes since their behavior is typically scattered around its elements with little meaning to an observer. The primary concern in safety critical systems development and assurance is the identification and management of hazards. The application of neural networks in systems where their failure can result in loss of life or property must be backed up with techniques to minimize these undesirable effects. Furthermore, to meet the requirements of many statutory bodies such as FAA, such a system must be certified. There is a growing concern in validation of such learning paradigms as continual changes induce uncertainty that limits the applicability of conventional validation techniques to assure a reliable system performance. In this paper, we survey the application of neural networks in high assurance systems that have emerged in various fields, which include flight control, chemical engineering, power plants, automotive control, medical systems, and other systems that require autonomy. More importantly, we provide an overview of assurance issues and challenges with the neural network model based control scheme. Methods and approaches that have been proposed to validate the performance of the neural networks are outlined and discussed after a comparative examination.",

abstract="A key problem in the adoption of artificial neural networks in safety-related applications is that misbehaviors can be hardly ruled out with traditional analytical or probabilistic techniques. In this paper we focus on specific networks known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and we propose a solution to verify their safety using abstractions to Boolean combinations of linear arithmetic constraints. We show that our abstractions are consistent, i.e., whenever the abstract MLP is declared to be safe, the same holds for the concrete one. Spurious counterexamples, on the other hand, trigger refinements and can be leveraged to automate the correction of misbehaviors. We describe an implementation of our approach based on the HySAT solver, detailing the abstraction-refinement process and the automated correction strategy. Finally, we present experimental results confirming the feasibility of our approach on a realistic case study.",
